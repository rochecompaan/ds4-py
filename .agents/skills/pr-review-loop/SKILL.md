# PR Review Loop

Run a bounded loop of fresh agent reviews and fixes on an open pull request,
then write the evidence into the PR description. A human reviewer can then
trust that the PR had full reviews with fixes, and spend their time on what
smells off, maintainability, and fit with the spec.

Files that come with this skill:

- `references/reviewer-prompt.md`: the prompt each reviewer gets.
- `references/review-criteria.md`: the criteria each reviewer gets.
- `references/agent-notes.md`: how to start a fresh reviewer and pick its
  model in specific coding agents.
- `assets/evidence-template.md`: the "Review evidence" section.
- `assets/pr-review-guidance.md`: text a project copies to adopt the process.

## Terms

- **Run:** one use of this skill on a PR. Runs are numbered from 1.
- **Round:** one fresh review of the whole branch, followed by fixes. A run
  has at most three rounds. Round numbers keep counting across runs.
- **Reviewed commit:** the head commit when a round starts.
- **Finding ID:** `R<round>-<number>`, such as `R2-3`. The number is the
  reviewer's issue number. IDs never change.
- **Evidence head:** the last commit the run produced or reviewed that is on
  the remote branch. See section 9.

## Rules that always apply

- Never decline or defer a finding without the author's approval.
- Never review your own fixes in place of a fresh reviewer.
- Never squash, rebase, amend, or force-push during the loop. Every fix
  commit stays on the branch so every commit link in the evidence works.
- Never create an issue the author did not pick.
- Only one writer works in the checkout at a time.
- Write one evidence section in the PR body. Do not post a comment per round.
- Every finding appears in the evidence, including declined and deferred
  ones.

## 1. Check that the loop can start

1. Run `git fetch origin`.
2. Read the PR for the current branch:

   ```bash
   gh pr view --json number,url,state,body,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,isDraft,closingIssuesReferences
   ```

3. Stop and tell the author if any of these is true:
   - there is no PR, or its state is not `OPEN` (a draft is fine);
   - the checked-out branch is not the PR's `headRefName`;
   - `git status --porcelain` prints anything;
   - `git rev-parse HEAD` does not equal `headRefOid`. Ask the author to push
     or pull first.

## 2. Find the project's rules

Do not bring your own rules. Take them from the project:

- coding, testing, and GitHub rules from `AGENTS.md` and the files it links;
- the commit message style from those rules and `git log -n 30 --format=%s`;
- validation commands from `AGENTS.md`, other project docs, and the CI
  workflows that run on pull requests.

Pick the validation commands that apply to the changed files. Leave out
commands the project marks as needing a person, such as tasks that touch a
live cluster. If you cannot tell which commands apply, ask the author once,
and suggest that they record the answer in `AGENTS.md`.

Find the requirements for the reviewer:

- each issue in `closingIssuesReferences`, and issues the PR body links,
  read with `gh issue view <number> --json title,body`;
- any spec or plan file that the PR body or a linked issue names.

If you find none, use `none found`.

## 3. Read the existing evidence

Count the lines of the PR body that consist of exactly
`<!-- pr-review-loop:start -->` or exactly `<!-- pr-review-loop:end -->`.
A marker inside other text on a line does not count.

- Neither marker: this is run 1 and round 1. There are no earlier findings.
- One of each, start before end: read the section. The new run number is one
  more than the highest Run in the rounds table. The next round number is one
  more than the highest Round. Earlier findings are the rounds table and the
  Fixed, Declined, and Deferred tables.
- Anything else: stop and ask the author to fix the PR body.

The trigger for this run is the author's words if they gave a reason when
they started the skill. Otherwise use `initial` for run 1 and `new commits`
for later runs.

## 4. Run each round

Repeat these steps until a stop condition in section 7 is met.

1. **Record the reviewed commit:** `git rev-parse HEAD`.
2. **Validate, round 1 only.** In round 1 of a run, run the validation
   commands on the reviewed commit, as section 8 describes. In later rounds,
   the previous round's step 7 already validated this commit. If a command
   fails on the branch but not on the merge base, the branch is not ready
   for review: stop early before starting a reviewer, and ask the author to
   fix the branch and run the skill again.
3. **Start a fresh reviewer.** See section 5. Fill in
   `references/reviewer-prompt.md`:
   - `{{PR_DESCRIPTION}}`: the PR body, without the evidence section;
   - `{{REQUIREMENTS}}`: the issues, spec, and plan from section 2;
   - `{{BASE_SHA}}`: `git merge-base origin/<baseRefName> <reviewed commit>`;
   - `{{REVIEWED_SHA}}`: the reviewed commit;
   - `{{EARLIER_FINDINGS}}`: the rounds and the Fixed, Declined, and Deferred
     tables from earlier rounds of this and earlier runs, or `none`;
   - `{{VALIDATION_COMMANDS}}`: each command and its result.

   Give the reviewer `references/review-criteria.md` with the prompt.
4. **Check the report.** It must have the sections the prompt asks for, with
   numbered issues and a final "Human Reviewer Callouts (Non-Blocking)"
   section. If the reviewer fails or the report is unusable, start one more
   fresh reviewer. If that also fails, stop early (section 11).
5. **Propose a ruling** on every finding: fix, decline with a reason, or
   defer. A decline reason cites a specific line, fact, or requirement. Also
   propose a ruling on every "Declined to judge" item: set it aside, or treat
   it as a finding. Either way, give it the next finding ID in this round. An
   item set aside goes in the Declined table with severity `Not graded` and
   the author's reason, so later reviewers and the human reviewer see it.
6. **Fix and ask.**
   - Fix the Critical and Important findings you propose to fix, without
     waiting: correctness findings first, then structural findings. See
     section 6.
   - Then send the author one message for the round. It lists every proposed
     decline and deferral, every Minor finding you propose to fix, and every
     "Declined to judge" ruling. The author approves each one or changes it
     to a fix.
   - Fix what the author changed to a fix, then the Minor findings the author
     approved.
7. **Validate** on the new head (section 8). Skip this when the round made
   no commits.
8. **Push.** Check that `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/<headRefName>` still
   prints the reviewed commit. If it does not, someone else pushed: stop
   early without pushing. Otherwise run `git push origin HEAD:<headRefName>`.
   Skip the push when the round made no commits.

## 5. Choose the reviewer

- Each round uses a fresh reviewer that has not seen the fixes being made.
  `references/agent-notes.md` says how to start one in specific agents.
- If no fresh reviewer is available, stop and say so. Do not review the
  branch yourself instead.
- Use the most capable model available.
- When more than one model family is available, change family each round,
  continuing from the family of the last round in the evidence. Different
  families find different problems.
- When only one family is available, keep going with it and say so in the
  Result line.

## 6. Make fixes and commits

- Give each accepted finding its own commit. When one change fixes several
  findings, one commit may name all of them.
- Follow the project's commit style and name the finding IDs, for example
  `fix(tasks): quote stage input before the guard (R1-1)`.
- A correctness fix comes with a test that fails before the fix and passes
  after, unless the project's testing rules rule out a new test. Run the test
  before the fix and see it fail.
- A structural fix is proven by a green suite.
- When no new test is written, record the direct check you used instead.
- You may hand a fix to one worker agent. It commits its own fix. Do not let
  two writers work in the checkout at the same time.
- If a fix or commit fails and you cannot resolve it, stop early.

## 7. Stop

Stop the run when either is true:

- **Clean round:** the round has no Critical or Important findings that were
  accepted for fixing. A round with no findings at all is clean, so a clean
  first round ends the run after one review. If a clean round fixes Minor
  findings, do not review again. Mark those fixes
  `not reviewed by a fresh reviewer`.
- **Cap reached:** this run has had three rounds. If the third round has
  accepted Critical or Important findings, fix them, validate, and push, but
  do not review again. Mark those fixes `not reviewed by a fresh reviewer`.

Then write the evidence (section 9) and ask about follow-up issues
(section 10).

## 8. Validate

- Run each validation command from section 2 and record the command and its
  result.
- Record a command you cannot run as `not run` with the reason.
- When a command fails, run it on the merge base in a separate worktree
  (`git worktree add <temp dir> <merge base>`). If it also fails there,
  record it as `baseline failure`, not as a pass. Remove the worktree after.
- When a command fails on the branch but not on the merge base before round
  1's review, stop early as step 2 of section 4 says. When it fails after a
  round's fixes, fix the failure before you push. If you cannot, stop early.

## 9. Write the evidence

1. Fill in `assets/evidence-template.md` from all runs:
   - **Evidence head:** the last commit the run reviewed or produced that is
     on the remote branch. This is the last pushed fix commit when the final
     round made fixes, and otherwise the commit the final round reviewed.
     Never name a commit that was not pushed.
   - Compare it with `headRefOid` from a fresh `gh pr view` and say whether
     it matches.
   - **Result:** this run's outcome and number of rounds, and the counts of
     fixed, declined, and deferred findings across all runs.
   - Add this run's rows to the rounds table and its findings to the Fixed,
     Declined, and Deferred tables, after the earlier rows.
   - When a later commit reverts or replaces an earlier fix, keep that row
     and its ID, and add `Reverted by <sha> (<reason>)` or
     `Later replaced by <ID>` to its Fix cell.
   - **Validation:** the results on the evidence head.
   - **Callouts:** the last round's callouts, merged with earlier callouts
     that still apply.
   - **Full reports:** add one collapsed block per round of this run after
     the earlier blocks. Before you add a report, replace every `<!--` in it
     with `&lt;!--` and every `</details>` with `&lt;/details>`, so a report
     that quotes the markers cannot break the section.
2. Read the PR body again right before writing, with
   `gh pr view <number> --json body`. Check the markers again as section 3
   does.
3. Replace only the text from the start marker to the end marker. If there
   are no markers, add the section to the end of the body after a blank line.
   Leave the rest of the body as written.
4. If the new body is longer than 65,536 characters, replace full reports
   with `Full report removed for size.`, oldest run first, until it fits.
   Never remove tables or callouts. If the body is still too long after every
   full report is removed, do not edit the PR. Tell the author that the
   evidence could not be written, give them the evidence section, and ask
   them to make room in the PR body. Then try this step again.
5. Write the body to a temporary file and run
   `gh pr edit <number> --body-file <file>`.

## 10. Ask about follow-up issues

After a clean or capped run, list the deferred findings that say
`not filed` and ask the author which should become issues. Create only the
issues the author picks, following the project's GitHub rules, with
`gh issue create`. Put the issue numbers in the Deferred table and write the
evidence again as section 9 describes. The others stay `not filed`.

## 11. Stop early

Stop early when:

- round 1 validation fails because of the branch;
- a reviewer fails twice in a row;
- someone else pushed to the branch during a round;
- a fix, commit, validation, or push fails and you cannot resolve it;
- the PR body markers are broken.

When you stop early, do not push work that failed validation. Write the
evidence you have, with outcome `Incomplete: <reason>`, unless the markers
are broken. If the run stops before the current round has a usable report,
add a rounds table row for that round with findings `-` and verdict
`Reviewer failed` or `Not reviewed: <reason>`. That keeps the run and round
numbers in the evidence, so the next run does not reuse them. List a fix
that was committed but not pushed in the Fixed table
with `not pushed: <reason>` in place of a commit link, so the evidence
never links to a commit the PR does not have. Do not ask about follow-up issues. Tell the author what
happened and what to do next.
