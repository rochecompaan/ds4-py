## Pull request review

Agent correctness review happens on the author's side, before a person
reviews the PR.

- Authors run the `pr-review-loop` skill before they request human review.
  They run it again after they push code changes, including changes made in
  answer to a human reviewer.
- We strongly recommend that human reviewers do not run agents for
  correctness reviews or post agent-written reviews. The author's loop
  already covers correctness, and agent reviews on the PR bring back the
  back-and-forth between agents that the loop replaces.
- Human reviewers check that the evidence head in the PR's "Review evidence"
  section matches the PR head. They read the declined and deferred findings
  and the human reviewer callouts. Then they look at what smells off,
  maintainability, and fit with the spec.
- A reviewer who doubts the evidence asks the author to run another loop.
